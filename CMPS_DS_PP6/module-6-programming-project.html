console.log("Project");

// 1. Implement the ArrayList using the prototype.

function ArrayList() {
  this.array = [];
}

ArrayList.prototype.insert = function(item) {
  this.array.push(item);
}

ArrayList.prototype.toString = function() {
  return this.array.join();
}

ArrayList.prototype.swap = function(array, index1, index2) {
  var aux = array[index1];
  array[index1] = array[index2];
  array[index2] = aux;
};

// 2. Complete the createNonSortedRandomArray(size) below by returning an
//    ArrayList with the numbers 1, 2, ..., size in random order.
//    NOTE: there are multiple ways to achieve this.

function createNonSortedRandomArray(size) {
  // create sorted array
  var list = createSortedArray(size);

  // shuffle using Fisher-Yates Shuffle
  for(var i = list.array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    list.swap(list.array, i, rand);
  }

  // return shuffled list
  return list;
}

function createSortedArray(size) {
  var array = new ArrayList();

  for(var i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    array.insert(i);
  }

  return array;
}

// 3. Implement the Quick Sort algorithm and test your code with the function
//    you wrote for (2).

ArrayList.prototype.quickSort = function() {
  this.quick(this.array, 0, this.array.length - 1);
};

ArrayList.prototype.quick = function(array, left, right) {
  var index;

  if(array.length > 1) {
    index = this.partition(array, left, right);

    if(left < index - 1) {
      this.quick(array, left, index - 1);
    }

    if(index < right) {
      this.quick(array, index, right);
    }
  }
};

ArrayList.prototype.partition = function(array, left, right) {
  var pivot = array[Math.floor((right + left) / 2)],
  i = left,
  j = right;

  while(i <= j) {
    while(array[i] < pivot) {
      i++;
    }

    while(array[j] > pivot) {
      j--;
    }

    if(i <= j) {
      this.swap(array, i, j);
      i++;
      j--;
    }
  }

  return i;
};

console.log("Quick Sort");
var test = createNonSortedRandomArray(10);
console.log(test.toString());
test.quickSort();
console.log(test.toString());

test = createNonSortedRandomArray(10);
console.log("Reshuffled list: " + test.toString());

// 4. Implement searching using the prototype.

ArrayList.prototype.sequentialSearch = function(item) {
  for(var i = 0; i < this.array.length; i++) {
    if(this.array[i] === item) {
      return i;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}

console.log("Sequential Search");
console.log(test.sequentialSearch(9));
console.log(test.sequentialSearch(3));
console.log(test.sequentialSearch(15));

// 5. Implement the binary search algorithm and test your code.

ArrayList.prototype.binarySearch = function(item) {
  this.quickSort();

  var low = 0,
      high = this.array.length - 1,
      mid, element;

  while (low <= high) {
    mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
    element = this.array[mid];

    if(element < item) {
      low = mid + 1;
    } else if(element > item) {
      high = mid - 1;
    } else {
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return -1;
};

console.log("Binary Search");
console.log(test.binarySearch(9));
console.log(test.binarySearch(3));
console.log(test.binarySearch(15));

// The following set of steps come from an earlier homework.
// The following text is from the all the Amendments in the Bill of Rights.
var text = "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

text.quickSort();
console.log("Sorted Text Array");
console.log(text.toString());

console.log("president? " + text.binarySearch("president"));

// 7. Use sorting and searching to find out whether the word 'state' appears
